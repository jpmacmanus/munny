A budgetting program I'm working on for personal use. I'm hoping to use this to replace a spreadsheet I'm currently using.

This will be a command line application with the ability to store and import a 'payment schedue', and produce graphs, weekly reports and other cool stuff like that.

### Planned features

- load save instances and budgets
- store current expected payments with a queue, and on loading a budget, iterate through and ask if these have been processed yet.
- display current weeks payments in the command line as well as search past weeks
- add periodic payments to a schedule easily, with start dates, end dates and cycle length.
- update, and delete planned payments.
- allow each weeks planned budget to be changed individually (but set up a default).
- report a timeline of how over and under budget you have gone through time.
